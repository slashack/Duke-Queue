## Overview

This repository contains my capstone project from school, developed using ASP.NET Razor Pages. The project is a school class selector application that allows users to log in, create accounts, configure profile settings, and add classes to their schedule. The backend database updates with any changes made by the user, ensuring data integrity and real-time updates.

## Features

- **Hashed Login and Account Creation:** Secure authentication and account management using hashed passwords.
- **Profile Configuration:** Users can customize their profile settings according to their preferences.
- **Class Scheduling:** Users can add classes to their schedule, with the backend database reflecting these changes.
- **Database Integration:** Real-time updates to the backend database with user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Razor Pages:** For building dynamic web pages with a clean separation of concerns.
- **Entity Framework:** For database interactions and ORM capabilities.
- **SQL Server:** For managing the backend database.
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive and modern UI design.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in the following areas:

1. **Web Development with ASP.NET Razor Pages:**
   - Understanding the MVC pattern and how Razor Pages streamline web development.
   - Building dynamic and interactive web applications with a clear separation of frontend and backend logic.

2. **Authentication and Security:**

4. **User Interface Design:**
   - Creating a responsive and user-friendly interface with Bootstrap.
   - Ensuring a seamless user experience through intuitive design and interaction.

5. **Project Management and Collaboration:**
   - Managing a full-stack project from conception to deployment with a team.
   - Collaborating with peers and instructors to refine the project and incorporate feedback.

This capstone project not only solidified my technical skills but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. It was an invaluable experience that prepared me for real-world software development challenges.
